My client wanted to create an ecommerce website for dropshipping, selling pet products.

To accomplish this, I used Wordpress to create a responsive website for all users (mobile, tablet & desktop). To populate the website with products to sell, I created PHP scripts to export pet products from Walmarts and import to Woocommerce. 

In the end, the client went on to starting his dropshipping business selling products exported from Walmart's inventory.
