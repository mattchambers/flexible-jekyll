My client wanted to build this app with the goal of making it the most user friendly and easy to use app of its kind today. 

I built this app from scratch. I first created the design of the app to match the design of the client's main website using Adobe Experience Design. Second, I used HTML, CSS/SASS and Javascript to create the structure, design and interactions of the app. The functionality of the app was created using the PHP framework, Laravel.

In the end, the client was very happy with the end results because it is exactly what they've been dreaming of for years. This app quickly grew in popularity against others like it and has a steady user base which continues to grow daily, ever since its initial launch.
