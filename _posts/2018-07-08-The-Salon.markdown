The client wanted a beautiful website that will mark their presence online and generate appointments from online users.

I built a dynamic website using the PHP framework, Laravel, making it dynamic in all aspects including its blog, services page & appointment scheduler.

Using my knowledge in SEO, I made sure to ensure this website was 100% responsive for all users (desktop - mobile). All pages are fully optimized for search engines for high volume search terms which to this day generates appointments organically. 

Using Facebook sponsored posts, I've created multiple campaigns targeting users of specific services offered by my clients and have generated over 100% ROI on all social campaigns.
